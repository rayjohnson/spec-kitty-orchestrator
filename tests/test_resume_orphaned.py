"""Tests for resuming orphaned in_progress WPs instead of false deadlock.

Background: list-ready never returns a claimed/in_progress WP. So a WP left in
one of those lanes by a prior/interrupted run (or an out-of-band
start-implementation, e.g. host-side testing) was invisible to the loop: it
scheduled nothing, polled empty, and raised a misleading "Dependency deadlock"
even though the WP just needed to be picked back up.

These tests pin the fix: the loop adopts orphaned resumable WPs, and only
reports a stall when there is genuinely nothing it can drive.
